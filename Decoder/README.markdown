This decoder was created by [On2 Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On2_Technologies). On2 was 
acquired by Google in August 2009 for their [VP8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP8) codec and its predecessors.

As of the end of 2020, their H.264 decoder source code was checked in to the repository on May 31, 2011. It
has not changed since that date.
